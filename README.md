# LanGameTests
My first LAN game // a "simple" LAN Game using python sockets and pygame. 
Feel free to modify and share, only with a link to this repo being knowledge to whoever is using it. 
I wish there was something like this when I tried to make it!

To run the game:
- check you have pygame installed on all computers
- run server.py on one computer
- run client.py on all the computers you want to play on (can also run on the computer running the server)
- enter the IP address of the computer running the server
- have fun! (best to play with at least 3 people, so find some family or friends to play with)

Modding?
Of course you can mod this! Just make sure to make it clear that it is a mod of this repo, NOT entirely your own game

Learning?
Use this as a learning resource as much as you want, totally disect the (admittedly not amazing) code and
maybe try to make it better? Try to understand the underlying logic and functionality of sockets.
This was really a test for me to use sockets so the rest of the code i gave little thought to, meaning it is 
not the best written by far.
